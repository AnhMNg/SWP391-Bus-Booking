# About The Project :v:
<br>
The travel needs of many people are increasing, we find that in addition to airplanes and trains, buses are still the first choice of many people because of cheap fares, suitable for short routes.
But there are many passenger transport companies in Vietnam, and each of these companies has its own website to book tickets. Many people will find it difficult to compare ticket price between different companies, that's why we made the "Here We Go" project. With the Here We Go website you can compare fares from many different companies on the same travel route, plus we can provide you with a reference on how to connect.
